**A private thinking canvas for visual exploration.**

## What is Glyph?

Glyph is a calm, minimal canvas for:

- **Deep thinking** — work through complex ideas visually
- **System design** — map out architectures and flows
- **Journaling with diagrams** — capture thoughts that words alone can't express
- **Idea exploration** — brainstorm without constraints

Your data stays local. Always private. No sign-ups required.

## Philosophy

Glyph is designed for personal use. It prioritizes:

1. **Privacy** — no accounts, no tracking, no cloud by default
2. **Simplicity** — clean strokes, minimal chrome
3. **Focus** — thinking tools, not collaboration features

## Based on Excalidraw

Glyph is a personal rebrand of [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com), an excellent open-source whiteboard. This fork focuses on solo thinking rather than collaboration.
